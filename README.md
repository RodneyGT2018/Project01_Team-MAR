PROBLEM / SOLUTION:  People who want to host or co-host events may not always have the time or resources.  The "My Party - Halloween Theme" app was created to help alleviate tasks of organizing an event while also allowing guests to contribute.  Specifically, this initial version of the app is designed to allow a host to create a Halloween party.  

Once the host signs up and inputs items such as the event location and initial list of items needed for the event, the app then allows others to sign up to attend the party.  Next, each guest that signs in to the app will have the opportunity to select an existing item to bring from the initial list created by the host or add an item to the list.  Other features include the ability to search Flickr for costume ideas and Google Maps to see the location of the event that was input by the host.
